The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to classify Hindi headlines into different categories (such as Sports, Technology, Economy, and Entertainment) using machine learning techniques. The project involves tasks such as text preprocessing, feature extraction using TF-IDF, model building, and evaluation to create a reliable classifier for Hindi headlines. The ultimate aim is to accurately predict the category of a given Hindi headline based on its content.
